# AI-Powered Interview Assistant - Project Summary

## 📋 Assignment Completion

This project fulfills all requirements of the Swipe Internship Assignment for building an AI-powered interview assistant.

### ✅ Core Requirements Met

#### 1. Two Synchronized Tabs
- **Interviewee Tab**: Chat-based interview interface
- **Interviewer Tab**: Dashboard showing all candidates
- Both tabs share the same Redux store, ensuring real-time synchronization

#### 2. Resume Upload & Parsing
- ✅ Accepts PDF files (required)
- ✅ Accepts DOCX files (optional)
- ✅ Extracts Name, Email, Phone using regex patterns
- ✅ Handles multiple resume formats gracefully

#### 3. Missing Field Collection
- ✅ Chatbot prompts for missing Name
- ✅ Chatbot prompts for missing Email
- ✅ Chatbot prompts for missing Phone
- ✅ Interview only starts after all fields are collected

#### 4. Interview Flow
- ✅ AI generates dynamic questions for Full Stack (React/Node) role
- ✅ 6 questions total: 2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard
- ✅ Questions shown one at a time
- ✅ Correct timers: Easy 20s, Medium 60s, Hard 120s
- ✅ Auto-submit when time runs out
- ✅ AI calculates final score after 6th question
- ✅ AI creates summary of candidate performance

#### 5. Interviewer Dashboard
- ✅ Shows all candidates with final scores
- ✅ Candidates ordered by score (highest first)
- ✅ Search by name, email, or phone
- ✅ Sort by score, name, status
- ✅ Filter by status (pending/in-progress/completed)
- ✅ Detailed view shows:
  - Profile information
  - All questions and answers
  - Individual question scores
  - Time spent per question
  - AI summary
  - Complete chat history

#### 6. Data Persistence
- ✅ All data stored in localStorage via Redux Persist
- ✅ Timers, answers, and progress all saved
- ✅ Data restored on page refresh
- ✅ "Welcome Back" modal for unfinished sessions

#### 7. Error Handling
- ✅ Invalid file format detection
- ✅ Missing field validation
- ✅ API failure fallback (uses default questions)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript
State Management: Redux Toolkit + redux-persist
UI Library: Ant Design
Build Tool: Vite
Parsing: pdf-parse, mammoth
AI: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
```

### Key Features

#### State Management
- **candidatesSlice**: Manages all candidate data
- **interviewSlice**: Manages interview flow and state
- Redux Persist: Automatic localStorage sync

#### Resume Parsing
- PDF parsing using pdf.js
- DOCX parsing using mammoth
- Regex-based field extraction
- Fallback for difficult-to-parse resumes

#### AI Integration
- Dynamic question generation based on resume
- Real-time answer evaluation with scoring
- Professional summary generation
- Fallback questions if API unavailable

#### Timer System
- Precise countdown for each question
- Visual progress indicators
- Auto-submit on timeout
- Timer state persisted across refreshes

#### UI/UX
- Clean, professional design
- Responsive layout
- Color-coded difficulty levels
- Real-time chat interface
- Comprehensive dashboard

## 🎯 How It Works

### Candidate Flow
1. **Upload Resume**: Drag & drop PDF/DOCX
2. **Parse Data**: Auto-extract name, email, phone
3. **Fill Missing**: Complete any missing info
4. **Start Interview**: AI generates 6 questions
5. **Answer Questions**: Respond within time limits
6. **Get Scored**: AI evaluates each answer
7. **View Results**: See final score and summary

### Interviewer Flow
1. **View Dashboard**: See all candidates ranked
2. **Search/Filter**: Find specific candidates
3. **View Details**: Click to see full profile
4. **Review Performance**: Check Q&A, scores, summary
5. **Make Decision**: Use data to evaluate candidate

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Component → Redux Action → Reducer → State Update
                ↓
State Changes → Component Re-renders → UI Updates
                ↓
Redux Persist → localStorage → Data Saved
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key (required)

### Build Output
- Development: `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173
- Production: `npm run build` → dist/
- Bundle size: ~2MB (includes PDF.js and Ant Design)

## 🚀 Deployment
